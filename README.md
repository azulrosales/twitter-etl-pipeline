#ETL Pipeline for Twitter data
This is an end-to-end data engineering solution that uses Airflow and Python to collect, process, and store data retrieved from the Twitter API.

The pipeline is deployed on Airflow running on an Amazon EC2 Ubuntu (virtual machine) instance for better performance and scalability. The final transformed data is then stored on Amazon S3, a highly scalable and reliable storage solution.
